# EchoTwin

Welcome to **Echo Twin**, an open-source, real-time digital twin in NVIDIA Omniverse. This project aims to create a simulated environment created via LiDAR.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  Compatible NVIDIA Driver
2.  [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
3.  [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
4.  A ROS 2 Sensor: A LiDAR or other sensor that publishes messages of type `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2`.
4.  (Optional) [Isaac Sim WebRTC Streaming Client](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/5.0.0/installation/download.html#isaac-sim-latest-release)


## Getting Started

This project is fully containerized, making setup quick and reproducible.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/9LogM/project-echo.git
    cd EchoTwin
    ```

2. **Configure the Node:**  
    Before launching, you must edit the `src/config.yaml` file to match your sensor's ROS 2 topics.

3.  **Build and run the container:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

3.  **View the Simulation:**  
    This project runs Isaac Sim in "headless" mode. To view the output, you can use a WebRTC streaming client.
    * Download and launch the Isaac Sim WebRTC Streaming Client for your operating system.
    * Connect to `127.0.0.1`. You should now see the live simulation.
